When the project opens, click on product --> run and wait for the simulator to load.  This may take a few seconds.
Open the Key9pi app and explore. Clicking on the text field will pull up the keyboard and you can select our custom keyboard. 
If it is not there, you can go to settings --> general --> keyboards and add our keyboard.
Clicking outside of the text field in the main app will dismiss the keyboard.  If you click on Go to change color scheme, you have a few options for our keyboard colors.
